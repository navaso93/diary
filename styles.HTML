<p><em>CONTENT SUBJECT TO ANY CHANGE AT ANYTIME</em></p>
<p>Through your life you go through experiences, good ones and bad ones, some you want to share and some you want to keep for yourself. This is a website (<em>as mentioned above, in construction</em>) that I want to use with two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn how to create content on-line, beginning with HTML, then CSS and hopefully some back-end in the near future, making it interactive</li>
    <li>Share stuff: experiences, pictures, opinions, music... I have no idea what content to write yet, I guess it will come to my mind spontaneaously</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>One thing I want to be able to do is to make real content. By real I mean not just the good and happy sides of life we all see daily in social media. I want to <strong>normalize bad moods, experiences or moments.</strong></p>
<p>Feelling bad, sad, or angry is completely normal, and fine. I believe our rejection to it is what keeps us fighting it. I guess you just gotta accept it and acknowledge it.</p>
<br>
<p>Easier saying it than doing it, of course.</p>
<br>
<p>By saying this I don't mean I want/will to share everything, or every mood I am in, but some times I might just make a statement of something that keeps me worried or in an uncomfortable state of mind. I also think (<em>and that's perhaps the most powerful reason</em>) that being 
    vulnerable and showing yourself like this sometimes, is a proof of self-confidence and self-appreciation. You gotta act like it to become it, or so I hope.</p>
