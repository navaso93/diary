<p><em>CONTENT SUBJECT TO ANY CHANGE AT ANYTIME</em></p>
<p>Through your life you go through experiences, good ones and bad ones, some you want to share and some you want to keep for yourself. This is a website (<em>as mentioned above, in construction</em>) that I want to use with two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn how to create content on-line, beginning with HTML, then CSS and hopefully some back-end in the near future, making it interactive</li>
    <li>Share stuff: experiences, pictures, opinions, music... I have no idea what content to write yet, I guess it will come to my mind spontaneaously</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>One thing I want to be able to do is to make real content. By real I mean not just the good and happy sides of life we all see daily in social media. I want to <strong>normalize bad moods, experiences or moments.</strong></p>
<p>Feelling bad, sad, or angry is completely normal, and fine. I believe our rejection to it is what keeps us fighting it. I guess you just gotta accept it and acknowledge it.</p>
<br>
<p>Easier saying it than doing it, of course.</p>
<br>
<p>By saying this I don't mean I want/will to share everything, or every mood I am in, but some times I might just make a statement of something that keeps me worried or in an uncomfortable state of mind. I also think (<em>and that's perhaps the most powerful reason</em>) that being 
    vulnerable and showing yourself like this sometimes, is a proof of self-confidence and self-appreciation. You gotta act like it to become it, or so I hope.</p>

<p> Now here's a beautiful form that I am gonna try to develop and play with. However, and before this, here's an <em>italic text</em> and a ><strong>bold text</strong>. Because why not?</p>
<br>
<p>Here's the form</p> 
<p><em>Wait... Let's put some headings before</em></p>
<h1>Heading1</h1>
<h2>Heading2</h2>
<h3>3...etc</h3>
<p>Or why not an order list...You know, with numbers and shit. Just cause the form is kinda the final big boss</p>
<ol>
    <li>Shi n1</li>
    <li>Shit n2</li>
    <li>Shit n3...And it ges like dis</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<p>Whatever, here we (after many line breaks lol) go with the form</p>
<form action="./index.html" method="POST">
    <label for="allergies">This this form's title/label looool, allergies</label>
    <input id="allergies" name="Name_idk" type="text">
    <input id="submitbutton" name="submit" type="submit">
</form>
<h2>WAIT</h2>
<p>As we sontinue reading, you might want to go back on top of the page cause I know it is beautiful.</p>
<p>You might want to do it by clicking <a href="#top">Here</a>. Lol hope it worked... Also the table colspan by the way. Well I don't really know what else I could try </p>
<br>
<p>Now let's use an image as a link to Google... Let's use... oh sure a Google logo. It doesn't get more original than this. Here we go:</p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?ie=UTF-8&rct=j" target="blank"><img src="Fotos/Google.png" alt="Link to Google search engine"></a>
<p>How about this <blockquote>Blockquote</blockquote></p>
